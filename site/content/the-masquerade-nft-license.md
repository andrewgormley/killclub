Summary of Licence 

You have complete freedom to use the Art and NFT for commercial and personal use including to make sales of derivative works, for so long as you own the NFT. 

To protect our community and the value of our collection, the licence has some limitations, specifically on the use of our NFTs in connection with damaging behaviour, for example hate crimes or racism, and we retain the underlying copyright to enable us to enforce this. 

1.0 Licence in NFTs 

1.1 We, Th3 Masqu3rad3 Ltd, (The Masquerade, us, we) grant, to the party who Owns an NFT we have issued (Licensee, you), for the time that party Owns the NFT, a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free licence in respect of the Art associated with the NFT purchase (Licence). 

1.2 Subject to clause 3 of this Licence, the Licence is assignable, transferrable and revocable to use, copy, display, and enjoy the Art associated with the NFT you Own: (a) for your own personal, and limited commercial use pursuant to clause 2 of this Licence; or (b) as part of a Marketplace or online gallery that permits the sale or transfer of the NFT you Own. 

1.3 Upon the sale of any NFT you Own, the Licence transfers to the purchaser who then Owns the NFT and the ownership of that NFT will be subject to and conditional upon compliance with the terms and conditions set out in this Licence. For the avoidance of doubt, the transfer of the Licence does not constitute commercial use for the purposes of clause 1.2. 

1.4 With immediate effect upon your sale of the NFT you Own, your rights under the Licence pursuant to clauses 1.1 and 1.2 shall cease to apply and will no longer be in force and effect. 

1.5 Except as expressly stated in this Licence, nothing in this Licence is intended to, or shall operate to, give you ownership of any Intellectual Property Rights in, or other rights in respect of the Art. 

1.6 The NFT may not be used in any way which would: (a) use the Art in connection with images depicting hatred, violence, intolerance, cruelty, or other inappropriate behaviour that could be reasonably considered to bring the owner of the Art into disrepute, or that could be reasonably considered to infringe on the rights of others; or (b) seek to trademark or acquire Intellectual Property Rights in the Art; or take, appropriate, or represent any ownership in the Art; or (c) involve the issue of an NFT which claims an association with the Art or which purports to be an NFT of the Art; or (d) assert any right to or over the Art in any manner inconsistent with the rights under this Licence; or (e) take any action which would or might invalidate, challenge, oppose, infringe, or otherwise put in dispute the owner’s title to the Art; or (f) be reasonably seen to disparage the Intellectual Property Rights of the owner; or (g) cause, permit, or assist any other person directly or indirectly to do any of the above acts. 

1.7 You understand and agree that if the Art associated with the NFT you Own may contain Third Party IP, that: (a) you will not have the right to use such Third Party IP in any way except as incorporated in the Art, and subject to this Licence; (b) depending on the nature of the licence granted from the owner of the Third Party IP, we may need to, subject to our discretion, place additional restrictions on the Licence; and (c) to the extent that we inform you in writing of additional restrictions under clause 1.7(b) of this Licence, you will be responsible for complying with all such restrictions from the date that you receive such written notice, and that failure to do so will be deemed a breach of this Licence. 

1.8 For the avoidance of any doubt: (a) the restrictions on the Licence survive termination or assignment transfer of this Licence; (b) this Licence is limited to the time you Own the NFT and upon your sale of the NFT to another party the Licence is assigned to the purchaser of the NFT and your rights under the Licence cease to have any effect, and you must draw to the other party’s attention the contents of this Licence prior to your sale of the NFT; and (c) the sale of your NFT does not constitute a “commercial use” of your NFT for the purposes of this Licence. 

2.0 Commercial and derivative rights 

2.1 You acknowledge that the NFT you Own contains individual layered files and traits that are owned by us. 

2.2 The NFT you Own may only be used for commercial purposes in its entirety as a whole, or as a basis for derivative works which are substantially altered from the original NFT and Art, but the NFT and Art may not be used to: (a) create merchandise using the NFT, once you no longer Own that NFT; or (b) create, sell or promote Counterfeit NFTs or associated collections. 

2.3 The Owner of commercial products or derivative works created using the Art from an NFT in accordance with this Licence shall not be liable to pay any Revenue Share on transfer of those goods. Any derivative works created in accordance with the terms of this Licence will be deemed to be sub-licenced under the terms of this Licence and subject to the terms of this Licence (other than any obligation to pay Revenue Share). 

2.4 For the avoidance of doubt, the individual layered files, traits and Art of the NFT you Own may not be used individually, separately or in combination of each other, other than as provided above, for commercial or any other purpose. 

3.0 Permissible transfers of the NFT you Own 

3.1 You and any future owner of the NFT you Own have a limited right to transfer the NFT you Own (Secondary Sale), provided that: (a) the transferee accepts all of the terms of this Licence and the current NFT Terms; (b) prior to the transfer, you have not breached this Licence or the current NFT Terms; and (c) we will be paid the Revenue Share percentage of the gross amounts paid by such party to the Secondary Sale. 

3.2 For the avoidance of doubt, the additional fees under clause 3.1(c) of this Licence do not include, and are not intended to cover, any additional fees imposed or required by the platform through which any Secondary Sale is being conducted. 

4.0 Termination 

4.1 In the event that the Owner of an NFT breaches the terms of this Licence, then we may terminate the Licence without notice and may take further steps including publishing the termination of the Licence and/or taking steps to seek to block the Art or the listing of an NFT subject to termination from any third party sites. Upon Termination any right to use the Art associated with an NFT which is Owned immediately ceases.
