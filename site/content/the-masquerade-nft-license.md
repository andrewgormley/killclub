Summary of Licence

* You have complete freedom to use the Art and NFT for commercial and personal use including to make sales of derivative works, for so long as you own the NFT.

  To protect our community and the value of our collection, the licence has some limitations, specifically on the use of our NFTs in connection with damaging behaviour, for example hate crimes or racism, and we retain the underlying copyright to enable us to enforce this.

### (c)            to the extent that we inform you in writing of additional restrictions under clause 1.7(b) of this Licence, you will be responsible for complying with all such restrictions from the date that you receive such written notice, and that failure to do so will be deemed a breach of this Licence.<br><br>

## 1.8           For the avoidance of any doubt:<br><br>

### (a)            the restrictions on the Licence survive termination or assignment transfer of this Licence;<br><br>

### (c)            the sale of your NFT does not constitute a “commercial use” of your NFT for the purposes of this Licence.<br><br>

## 2.1           You acknowledge that the NFT you Own contains individual layered files and traits that are owned by us.<br><br>
