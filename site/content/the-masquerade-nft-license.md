# The Masquerade NFT License

Meta Description: The Masquerade NFT License

Summary of Licence

* You have complete freedom to use the Art and NFT for commercial and personal use including to make sales of derivative works, for so long as you own the NFT.

  To protect our community and the value of our collection, the licence has some limitations, specifically on the use of our NFTs in connection with damaging behaviour, for example hate crimes or racism, and we retain the underlying copyright to enable us to enforce this.

# [](https://themasqueradenft.com/admin/)1.1           We, Th3 Masqu3rad3 Ltd, (The Masquerade, us, we) grant, to the party who Owns an NFT we have issued (Licensee, you), for the time that party Owns the NFT, a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free licence in respect of the Art associated with the NFT purchase (Licence).<br><br>

## 1.6           The NFT may not be used in any way which would:<br><br>

### (a)            use the Art in connection with images depicting hatred, violence, intolerance, cruelty, or other inappropriate behaviour that could be reasonably considered to bring the owner of the Art into disrepute, or that could be reasonably considered to infringe on the rights of others; or<br><br>

### (e)            take any action which would or might invalidate, challenge, oppose, infringe, or otherwise put in dispute the owner’s title to the Art; or<br><br>

### (a)            you will not have the right to use such Third Party IP in any way except as incorporated in the Art, and subject to this Licence;<br><br>

### [](https://themasqueradenft.com/admin/)(b)            depending on the nature of the licence granted from the owner of the Third Party IP, we may need to, subject to our discretion, place additional restrictions on the Licence; and<br><br>

### (c)            to the extent that we inform you in writing of additional restrictions under clause 1.7(b) of this Licence, you will be responsible for complying with all such restrictions from the date that you receive such written notice, and that failure to do so will be deemed a breach of this Licence.<br><br>

## 1.8           For the avoidance of any doubt:<br><br>

### (a)            the restrictions on the Licence survive termination or assignment transfer of this Licence;<br><br>

### (b)            this Licence is limited to the time you Own the NFT and upon your sale of the NFT to another party the Licence is assigned to the purchaser of the NFT and your rights under the Licence cease to have any effect, and you must draw to the other party’s attention the contents of this Licence prior to your sale of the NFT; and<br><br>

### (c)            the sale of your NFT does not constitute a “commercial use” of your NFT for the purposes of this Licence.<br><br>

## 2.1           You acknowledge that the NFT you Own contains individual layered files and traits that are owned by us.<br><br>
