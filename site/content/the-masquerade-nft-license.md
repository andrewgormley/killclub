description: The Masquerade NFT License
---
**Summary of Licence**

* You have complete freedom to use the Art and NFT for commercial and personal use including to make sales of derivative works, for so long as you own the NFT.

  To protect our community and the value of our collection, the licence has some limitations, specifically on the use of our NFTs in connection with damaging behaviour, for example hate crimes or racism, and we retain the underlying copyright to enable us to enforce this.
