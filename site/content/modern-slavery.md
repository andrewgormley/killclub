## Modern Slavery & Human Trafficking Statement

This statement is made on behalf of Baked Creative Limited pursuant to section 54 (1) of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 (the “Act”) and constitutes our slavery and human trafficking statement.

This statement sets out Baked’s actions to understand all potential modern slavery risks related to its business and to put in place steps that are aimed at ensuring that there is no slavery or human trafficking in its own business and its supply chains. This statement relates to actions and activities during the financial year 1 January 2022 to 31 December 2022. Baked recognises that it has a responsibility to take a robust approach to preventing slavery and human trafficking and is committed to do so in our corporate activities and supply chains.

#### Organisational Structure

Baked Creative Limited is a company registered in England and Wales (12099792). Baked is a creative agency operating globally across EMEA, APAC and the US, with its European HQ in Torquay, TQ2 5EG.

#### Our Approach

We strive to work to the highest professional standards and comply with all laws, regulations and rules relevant to our business.

At UK level, our leadership team work in conjunction with our procurement functions to help ensure that the aims and provisions of the Act are complied with and to manage any concerns or breaches.

Our recruitment and employment procedures include appropriate pre-employment screening of all staff to determine right to work in the UK. They also receive an induction which explains all Baked company policies and confirms that employees are able to contact the leadership team confidentially on any matter of concern, throughout their employment. We expect all employees to conduct business with honesty and integrity and we have a zero-tolerance approach to bribery and corruption

#### Company Policy

Baked company policies work to identify and prevent any sort of slavery and human trafficking within its operations. Baked works to maintain high professional and ethical standards and ensures its employees know their role in maintaining these.

We do not tolerate any form of modern slavery or human trafficking in any part of our business.

#### Due Diligence / Risk Assessment

Sustainable Procurement is an integrated value in our supply chain management. We seek to trade with suppliers who match and complement our ethical standards and organisational values whilst seeking to minimise the environmental impacts arising from the delivery of their goods or services. We are committed to the following:

* Mapping the supply chain to assess particular product or geographical risks
* Evaluating the modern slavery and human trafficking risks of each new supplier
* Reviewing on a regular basis all aspects of the supply chain
* Taking steps to improve sub-standard suppliers’ practices
* Entering into business relationships with suppliers that reflect our organisational values.
* Work with our suppliers to ensure that they drive ethical and sustainable business practices throughout their organisations

Supplier responses are taken into consideration when short-listing and we make any concerns known to the supplier. Should suppliers fail to live up to our expectations or be unwilling to make any changes we may cease to engage with them.

#### Further Steps

We will be looking to introduce specific measures to ensure that our obligations under the Act are passed through our supply chain. These will include:

* Obtaining contractual warranties through completion of a risk assessment questionnaire to confirm that no slavery is used anywhere in the supplier’s business or by any of the suppliers in its supply chain and that all necessary processes and policies have been put into place to ensure that this remains the case
* Obtaining a contractual right to request compliance-related information and the right to audit suppliers at our discretion
* Ensuring risk areas are documented, monitored and taken into consideration in any future contract renewals
* Assessing supply chain level information and engaging directly with suppliers to set up systems that provide reliable supply chain information, especially for the most at risk jurisdictions.

#### Training

Relevant e-learning training materials are available to all staff and will be made compulsory for those involved in recruiting and sourcing/managing a supply chain so that they are able to identify risk factors, understand the implications and assist us with implementing the requirements of the Act effectively.

This statement is made pursuant to section 54 (1) of the UK Modern Slavery Act 2015 and constitutes Baked’s slavery and human trafficking statement for the financial year ending 31st December 2022.

This statement was approved by Dan Bulman, CEO of Baked Creative Limited, and will be updated and reviewed annually.
