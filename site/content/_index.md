brandCopy: >
  London. September, 1940. The height of the Blitz. A ruined warehouse plays
  host to a nightly gathering of lost souls. Reality and fiction are impossible
  to distinguish. Deception is the only constant.


  This is the Masquerade. Trust no one.

    title: Identity Cards
    copy: >
      Total war. As part of The Masquerade, lost souls will be recorded under an
      Identity Registration scheme, Taken holders will be issued with a
      physical, individual identity card that should be carried at all times
      when on the Masquerade property. Lost souls may be rewarded for holding
      their card at NFT events. Lost souls found to be without their cards will
      incur The Host’s wrath.

    title: Shelters
    copy: >
      For the under-represented, The community will manage a hardship fund to
      help lost souls who face discrimination which prevents them from achieving
      their goals. Age, gender, sexual orientation, race and religious
      discrimination are just some of the ways talented people are held back.
      Our Shelter fund will help to change that.
  - mark: "4."
    title: Maps
    copy: >
      Each year, beginning in 2023, 10 lost souls will be chosen by the
      community to join The Host on The Journey, an all-expenses-paid trip
      across the world. Each stop on the map will have a significance and a
      specific reason for its existence.


      At each stage, lost souls will be representing the wider The Masquerade community - giving back to the under-represented, making new friends and discovering new opportunities.


      The wider community will directly benefit from the activities undertaken by The Host and the 10 chosen lost souls. Lost souls who have previously experienced The Journey will be ineligible to take part again, but will be additionally rewarded with unique collectables based on the experiences undertaken.

    title: Letters
    copy: >
      Letters have played crucial part in history for thousands of years. The
      first ever handwritten letter is thought to have been sent by the Persian
      Queen Atossa in around 500 BC.


      Communication helps us build relationships by allowing us to share our experiences, and needs, and helps us connect to others. It's the essence of life, allowing us to express feelings, pass on information and share thoughts. We all need to communicate.


      The Masquerade will set up lines of communication between our members. To begin, lost souls will be able to opt-in to receiving letters from one other member of their choosing. The Masquerade will act as the conduit, ensuring privacy and confidentially is maintained at all times.


      Based on feedback from the community, we will expand this facility as required.

      “Photography is the story I fail to put into words.” - Destin Sparks


      The Masquerade will bring global communities together through a shared appreciation of creativity, storytelling and altruism.


      The Host will place creative photography marked with QR codes in 50 cities worldwide. In order to locate the photography, lost souls will need to participate in The Hunt, a cryptic game which will result in the location of the photography being revealed.


      Lost souls who successfully locate the photography and scan the QR code will be rewarded handsomely based on the photograph they discover and the city location where it is found.


      Are you ready for the challenge?

    title: The Warehouse
    copy: >
      The warehouse is The Masquerade’s flagship activation event. A cultural
      milestone for the brand, the NFT space and for wider collaborators.


      The first events, held in the USA and London, are scheduled for Q3 2023 (USA) and Q4 2023 (London).


      The Masquerade is no ordinary gathering. In the dark night, who can you really trust?


      Surrounded by pretence. Consumed by the experience. Immersed in the night.


      A ruined warehouse plays host to a nightly gathering of lost souls. Concealed by masks, but bared to the night. The Masquerade doesn't change us. It simply exposes who we really are.


      Under the relentless blackout, factions form. Alliances are made - and broken. Not everyone is who they seem. Enemies lurk within. Exploiting the night for their own ends.

      Reality and fiction are impossible to distinguish. Deception is the only constant.


      This is The Masquerade. Trust no one.

    title: The Unknown
    copy: >
      The future in this space is incredibly exciting.


      We are building The Masquerade into a brand which goes beyond the reliance on secondary sales, generating revenue from multiple streams including media, advertising sales and events.


      Our ambitious plans all start with one principle: adding value back to those who place their trust in us enough to buy and hold The Masquerade NFTs. We will underpromise and overdeliver.


      Expect the unexpected.

      Consumed by the experience.

      Immersed in the night.
